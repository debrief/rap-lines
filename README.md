# RapLines
Trials &amp; demonstrators associated with reproducible analytical pipelines, as discussed [here].

The demonstrator application will consider how changes to a dataset can be viewed as a sequence of changes, in a method similar to Event Sourcing.

Eventually the application will allow each change to be retrospectively amended with visualisation of subsequently changed end-result data.

It will be possible for user to group a set of changes into a composite unit, to allow management of the data flow at a higher level.
